As an irreplaceable component of the modern business fields, e-commerce now has gained more importance through customersâ€™ growing preferences of convenient buying and selling, and the emergence of abundant merchants, including a larger portion of small business owners, who stand out by online transaction only. E-commerce encompasses a wide variety of data, systems, and tools for online buyers and sellers, including mobile shopping and online payment encryption. With the promotion of big data, e-commerce businesses are able to collect and build robust databases on transaction, inventory, shipping, and other related information generated during activities. The implementation of information technology makes it easier for businesses to track and predict their sales growth and therefore adjust current pricing strategies.
